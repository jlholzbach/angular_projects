This is a project being created as I make my way through an course on Angular. It still far from being completed.
Ultimately the goal is there for to be a list of recipes that can be viewed, and items from there added to a shopping
list. Recipes will be able to be created, and edited. The shopping list however appears to be limited to only one, with items being capable of being added or removed.
